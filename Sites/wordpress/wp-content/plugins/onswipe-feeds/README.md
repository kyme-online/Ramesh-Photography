Onswipe Feeds
=============

This plugin provides a new feed that is full-text and includes the featured image in the first <media:thumbnail> and <media:content> tags. New feed located at /?feed=onswipe. Any inline images are scraped and put into additional <media:content> tags. This includes galleries posted inline with the [gallery] shortcode.

Lots of code taken from Andy Skelton's MRSS and Dinesh Karki's "Featured Image in RSS Feeds" plugins.
